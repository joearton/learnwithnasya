# Learn With Nasya 🎓📚

Welcome to **Learn With Nasya**, a fun, interactive platform built using Python and OpenAI's Whisper and GPT APIs to help kids (and adults!) learn how to pronounce and understand English words 🗣️💡.

This project is inspired by the real learning journey of a child named Nasya, and it aims to create an accessible and personalized educational tool that listens, transcribes, and offers helpful feedback — just like a patient teacher!

---

## 🛠️ Features

- 🎤 **Voice Input**: Speak a word and the app will listen!
- 📝 **Speech-to-Text**: Uses OpenAI's Whisper to transcribe speech.
- 🤖 **AI Feedback**: GPT provides constructive feedback on pronunciation and suggests improvements.
- 🌍 **Multilingual Support**: Can be adapted for ESL learners.
- 💻 **Local or Cloud Processing**: Whisper and GPT can be run locally or via OpenAI's API.

---

## 📸 Demo

> _Coming soon!_ A short video will show how Nasya interacts with the tool to learn pronunciation in real time. Stay tuned! 🎥

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- [OpenAI Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for speech recognition
- [OpenAI GPT-4](https://platform.openai.com/) for feedback generation
- **Flask** for the backend
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (optional frontend extensions)
