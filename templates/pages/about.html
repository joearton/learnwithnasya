      <p class="lead text-muted">An English learning platform born from love, built for everyone.</p>

        <p><strong>Learn With Nasya</strong> began as a personal project—a site I developed (partially using AI) to help my own daughter, <strong>Nasya</strong>, overcome her challenges in learning English. What started as a tool for one child has now grown into a joyful, accessible space for many.</p>

        <p>This platform is designed to assist young children—especially non-native speakers—in reading, pronouncing, and understanding English words and sentences, in a way that feels fun, natural, and non-intimidating.</p>

        <ul class="list-unstyled ps-3">
          <li>📖 <strong>Read</strong> and explore everyday English</li>
          <li>🗣️ <strong>Practice pronunciation</strong> with ease</li>
          <li>💬 <strong>Receive real-time feedback</strong> with friendly guidance</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By transforming language learning into delightful games, Learn With Nasya makes it easier for children to gain confidence and joy in their learning journey—at their own pace, in their own way.</p>

        <hr class="my-5">

        <h4>🎯 Our Mission</h4>
        <p>Our goal is simple: to make language learning more accessible, especially for children. We aim to provide:</p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled ps-3">
          <li>✅ A platform anyone can use—anytime, anywhere</li>
          <li>✅ An intuitive experience, even for the youngest learners</li>
          <li>✅ A safe, minimal, and child-friendly interface</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Every child deserves a kind, patient, and supportive environment to grow their communication skills—and that's what we're building.</p>

        <hr class="my-5">

        <h4>🧠 Powered by Smart Technology</h4>
        <p>Leveraging <strong>speech recognition</strong>, <strong>text-to-speech</strong>, and interactive feedback, Learn With Nasya acts like a gentle tutor—providing encouragement and corrections without pressure or judgment.</p>
